# EV Safety Analysis

### Introduction
With electric vehicles (EVs) becoming increasingly popular, there’s growing interest in how this surge impacts public safety. This project investigates whether EV growth correlates with safer roads or introduces new challenges. By analyzing EV adoption and crash data, we explore how EV design, awareness, and technology may shape road safety outcomes.

### Investigation
We ask: **Are we trading one set of benefits for unforeseen risks?**  
By comparing EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, this analysis examines:
- Crash rates and causes between EV and non-EV vehicles  
- Tesla’s impact on overall EV adoption  
- How EV characteristics (weight, acceleration, noise) affect driver behavior  

Our audience includes policymakers, transportation authorities, and researchers interested in the intersection of safety and technology.

### Interactive Visualizations
1. **EV Purchases Over Time** — Growth in EV vs Tesla purchases (Plotly line graph)  
2. **EV vs Non-EV Crash Causes** — Comparison of crash types by cause (stacked bar)  
3. **Combined Trends** — EV purchases vs EV-related crashes per year (overlayed trends)

**Insights:**
- Tesla purchases strongly correlate with overall EV adoption.  
- Non-EVs still account for most crashes, though EV-related incidents are rising.  
- Despite more EVs, crash rates remain relatively low—likely due to newer tech and improved safety systems.
